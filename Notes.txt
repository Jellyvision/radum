Group Types
===========

Group Scope       Group Type        Can Be Primary    groupType Value
-----------       ----------        --------------    ---------------
Domain Local      Security          No*               0x80000004 (-2147483644)
Domain Local      Distribution      No                0x4 (4)
Global            Security          Yes               0x80000002 (-2147483646)
Global            Distribution      No                0x2 (2)
Universal         Security          Yes               0x80000008 (-2147483640)
Universal         Distribution      No                0x8 (8)

* = Apparently you can change a group which someone has as their primary group
    to Domain Local/Security and not get an error, but you cannot select such
    a group as a user's primary group. Therefore, I take this as not "really"
    being able to use that as a primary group. In other cases, you will get an
    error changing to the "Distribution" scope if someone has that group as
    their primary group.

Some of those hex values are Bignums, so I put their Fixnum values as integers.
I actually use the integer values for the larger ones in the code. The AD
Users and Group (or ADSI Edit) applications shows these as the integer values
if you try and edit them, so I am just doing what Microsoft does :-)

Keeping in mind the restriction that only "Security" type groups can be used
for primary groups (see the note above for Domain Local scope), the following
transformations are possible with respect to Group Scope:

Domain Local --> Universal
Global --> Universal
Universal --> Domain Local
Universal --> Global

If you change a group to Universal, you can then change it to whatever you
want it seems.


Disabled Users
==============

The AD attribute userAccountControl appears to contain the following flags with
respect to an account being enabled or disabled (in the code, I simply look
for the disabled value and set the class attribute appropriately - the "dsmod"
command has a specific option for disabling an account, so that's all I care
about really).

userAccountControl Disabled = 0x202
userAccountControl Enabled  = 0x200 (apparently, probably other values for
                                     whatever, I just care about 0x202 here)
